# QuickOrderedSet

This framework is a basic Ordered Set for Swift. It was heavily inspired by [Weebly's Ordered Set](https://github.com/Weebly/OrderedSet), but that one crashed unexpectedly on certain occasions.

There are definitely some features this is missing, but it generally works and doesn't crash!

("quick" is a synonym for "swift")
